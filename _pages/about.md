Thank you for visiting this website! As a fourth year undergraduate student from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu), I am currently pursuing my neuroscience and cognitive study bachelor's degree in [School of A&S](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/).

My current research interests encompass gamification research in rehabilitation study, cochlear implantation, machine learning, and chronobiology. As a video game enthusiast, I have always been drawn to work that bridges game development and clinical research. With a strong foundation in computer science and neuroscience from Vanderbilt University, I have developed both research abilities and computational skills through extensive academic and research experiences. I have two research lab experiences during my undergraduate education. 

In [Cochlear Implant Cognition and Communication Lab](https://www.vumc.org/ent/CICCL) led by Dr. Aaron Moberly and Dr. Terrin Tamati in Vanderbilt University Medical Center, our aim is predicting cochlear implant outcomes prior to surgery, along with exploring the auditory and social experiences of adults receiving cochlear implants. To broaden our assessments of outcomes to capture aspects of patients' real-world communication functioning, I assessed the feasibility and the effectiveness of a self-designed gamified remote training protocol as a rehabilitation method primarily for enhancing indexical processing abilities in adult cochlear implantation users, and conducted the PRESTO sentence test to incorporate variability across multiple linguistic and indexical dimensions, including talker gender, regional dialect, and sentence structure. My major research curiosity foucues on unravelling the potential of remote auditory trainings and introducing more cost-efficient and time-efficient training alternatives for people with hearing loss.
