As a fourth year undergraduate student from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu), I am currently pursuing my neuroscience and cognitive study bachelor's degree in [School of A&S](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/).

My current research interests encompass gamification research in rehabilitation study, cochlear implantation, machine learning, and chronobiology.
