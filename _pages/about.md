Thank you for visiting this website! As a fourth year undergraduate student from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu), I am currently pursuing my neuroscience and cognitive study bachelor's degree in [School of A&S](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/).

My current research interests encompass gamification research in rehabilitation study, cochlear implantation, machine learning, and chronobiology. As a video game enthusiast, I have always been drawn to work that bridges game development and clinical research.

With a strong foundation in computer science and neuroscience from Vanderbilt University, I have developed both research abilities and computational skills through extensive academic and research experiences. I have two research lab experiences during my undergraduate education. In [Cochlear Implant Cognition and Communication Lab](https://www.vumc.org/ent/CICCL) led by Dr. Aaron Moberly and Dr. Terrin Tamati in Vanderbilt University Medical Center, I assessed the feasibility and the effectiveness of a self-designed gamified remote training protocol as a rehabilitation method primarily for enhancing indexical processing abilities in adult cochlear implantation users, and gained hand-on experiences in integrating 2000+ lines of code in Matlab and R which helps sustain an auto-scoring program to facilitate professional audiologists.
